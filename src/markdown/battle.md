This App is the result of the awesome course [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com) by Tyler McGinnis.

This app uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to showcase the most popular repositories. The user can also select between different languages to filter the results.

Additionally, the user can search and select two GitHub users to 'battle' each other. The application will find those users, analyze them and declare a winner.
