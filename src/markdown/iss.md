Know exactly where the **International Space Station** is and who is on board.

For some time I wanted to do something simple that would tell me where the ISS is. I know there are plenty of places to look for that information, but considering that it's always a good time to continue exploring the Google API, I decided to build it myself.

**Built it with:**
- Vanilla ES6 JavaScript
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)
- [Where the ISS at?](https://wheretheiss.at/)
- [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/)
