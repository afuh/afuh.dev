A simple fake quote machine.

I put together a bunch of ancient quotes of [Diego Maradona](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Armando_Maradona) in a `.json` file together with an array of outstanding personalities of history. Mixing them randomly gives pretty funny results.

I also did this project to exercise the Object Literal pattern while I was reading this great e-book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript) by [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/)

This is a project as described in [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine).

*I considered translating it into English, but it's better to leave Diego Armando Maradona in his original language.*
