A minimalist UI image slider.

If the user does not interact with the Image Slider for a certain amount of time, the images will start to slide automatically until the user interact with it again. This way the user will never be bothered by the auto-slide.

This project was suggested by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/creating-an-image-carousel-slider) curriculum and helped me to exercise Module Patterns as described in this great e-book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript) by [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/).

All the images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
