A restaurant site that use tabbed browsing to access the Menu, About Us and Contact pages.

This is a project as described in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery) but instead of building it in JQuery (as proposed) I decided to do it with React as I read the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html).

I use [Chance.js](http://chancejs.com/) for the random info and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the images.

This is my first App using React.
