A simple JQuery calculator

The main idea from the beginning was **not** to use `eval()` and do everything myself.

This is a project as described in [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/on-screen-calculator).
