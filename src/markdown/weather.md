Show the local weather.

The user can search a location by city, country or ZIP code and access the current weather and a 5 days forecast.  

After completing the great course [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com) by Tyler McGinnis, I continued exercising with React and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and made this simple weather app using [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/) and [IP-API](http://ip-api.com/).

This is also my version of the project as described in [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather).
