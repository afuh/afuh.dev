This is the classic [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) where the player controls a snake that grows longer with each piece of food it eats. The player loses if the snake gets so big it hits itself or if it goes off the board.

In this project I decided to use the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

This is a project as described in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/jquery-and-the-dom).
