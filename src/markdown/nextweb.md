This is news magazine clone of the [The Next Web's](https://thenextweb.com) layout.

I built it in React with the great and simple [News api](https://newsapi.org/) using different sources:
- [National Geographic](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/)
- [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/)
- [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com)
- [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/)
- [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/)

This is a project as described in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design).
