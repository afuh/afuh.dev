[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) is a great course by Wes Bos. The main idea is to build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no compilers, no libraries, no boilerplate.

I took this course to focus on learn and practice DOM manipulation.

This is a showcase with all my exercises.
