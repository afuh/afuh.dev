A 16 Step Sequencer built with JQuery and [Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/).

This was an interesting challenge. I started building it as soon as I started learning JavaScript and it was quite hard to making it work. I already updated it a couple of times because of the new things that I've learned, and I guess I will continue to do so in the future.
