[Music sequencers][1] have always been a significant source of inspiration in my life (you can learn more about it on my old [YouTube channel][5]). The idea of building a 16-step sequencer for the web was my main reason for diving into web development.

Several years ago, I was driven to create a web-based step sequencer, but I had no idea where to start. After doing some research and talking to a few developer friends, I started my learning journey with resources like [FreeCodeCamp][3] and [The Odin Project][4].

A couple of months later, equipped with newfound confidence in my JavaScript and [Web Audio API][2] skills, I was eager to get started on this rewarding project.
