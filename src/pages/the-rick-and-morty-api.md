The Rick and Morty API is an open REST(ish) and GraphQL API based on the television show [Rick and Morty][2]. You will have access to about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show.

Currently the API is being used by multiple applications, both web and mobile. It's also regularly used in development schools and lectures at [tech conferences][tech-twit].
