Are you curious about how many [humans][2] are currently in space or the real-time location of the [International Space Station][1]? You've landed in the perfect place! This app provides the answers to all your cosmic questions.

A few years back, I was curious about the precise location of the ISS at a specific time. This curiosity inspired the development of this small app. Using public APIs (http://api.open-notify.org and https://api.wheretheiss.at), this app brings real-time data about the ISS and presents it on an easy-to-read map.
