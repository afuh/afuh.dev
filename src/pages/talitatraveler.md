Embark on a journey with Talita Traveler, a 15+ year old personal blog featuring an eclectic mix of short stories, predictions, fake news, poems, and science-related literature, all infused with a touch of humor.

If you know a little bit of Spanish, I'd definitely recommend you take a look at it.

Talita Traveler was an outdated WordPress theme-based site. We decided to move the entire content to a [headless CMS][1] and from there develop a modern API-based decoupled blogging site.
